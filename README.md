# Overview
This repository is a submit box for each step of my quest to learn how to program the **STM32**. Each folder typically copies its content to the next folder; changes and additions will be mentined by either VFor now, I will complete each part up to Part 10: UART.

Each folder houses project files for each part of Vivinomicon's "Bare Metal STM32 Programming":

Each folder typically copies its content to the next folder; changes and additions will be mentioned by the associated blog post or the README.

# Author's notes 
My submissions were written in a Linux VM I created for educative purposes. For my other hobby projects, I program the STM32 with an Eclipse IDE in my Windows host machine.

Edit: Now running on two virtual Linux machines. Cloning this repository with SSH.
