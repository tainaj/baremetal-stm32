# Author's notes 
My submissions were written in a Linux VM I created for educative purposes. For my other hobby projects, I program the STM32 with an Eclipse IDE in my Windows host machine.

Edit: Now running on two virtual Linux machines. Cloning this repository with SSH. Now trying Vivonomicon's arm-none-eabi-gdb...
