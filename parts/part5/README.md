# Part 5: Timer Peripherals and the System Clock
This repository is a submit box for Part 5 of Vivonomicon's **"Bare Metal" STM32 Programming** blog series:

## Hardware
For this lab, I used development boards for the STM32F051R8 and STM32L031K6 chips.

## Software
Firmware packages for STM32F051R8T6 and STM32L031K6T6 have been imported from the previous lab.

## Procedure
The following are featured in Part 5:
* Optimize flash memory latency with the FLASH register
* Initializing and enabling the PLL clock with the RCC register
* Set up TIM2 basic timer peripheral to toggle an LED every second

## Author's notes 
Very straightforward. Nothing else said here besides what's been said by Vivonomicon.
